## About the AI Ethics Principles

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics Principles guide businesses and governments to responsibly design, develop, and implement AI. These voluntary principles aim to ensure AI is safe, secure, and reliable, and to help:

- achieve safer, more reliable, and fairer outcomes for all Australians
- reduce the risk of negative impacts on those affected by AI applications
- encourage the highest ethical standards in AI design, development, and implementation

## AI Ethics Principles at a glance

1. Human, societal and environmental wellbeing: AI systems should benefit individuals, society, and the environment.
2. Human-centred values: AI systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals.
3. Fairness: AI systems should be inclusive and accessible, and should not result in unfair discrimination.
4. Privacy protection and security: AI systems should respect privacy rights, protect data, and ensure security.
5. Reliability and safety: AI systems should reliably operate in accordance with their intended purpose.
6. Transparency and explainability: People should understand when they are significantly impacted by AI and when an AI system is engaging with them.
7. Contestability: When an AI system significantly impacts people, there should be a timely process to challenge its use or outcomes.
8. Accountability: Responsible parties across the AI lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable, with human oversight enabled.

## AI Ethics Principles in detail

### 1. Human, social and environmental wellbeing

AI systems should benefit individuals, society, and the environment throughout their lifecycle. Objectives should be clearly identified and justified. Impacts should be considered across the AI system's lifecycle, including external impacts beyond the organization.

### 2. Human-centred values

AI systems should align with human values, respect and promote human rights, protect autonomy, and avoid deception, unfair manipulation, and unjustified surveillance. Diverse perspectives should inform design and deployment.

### 3. Fairness

AI systems should be inclusive, accessible, and avoid unfair discrimination. Stakeholders should be consulted, and decisions should comply with anti-discrimination laws.

### 4. Privacy protection and security

AI systems should uphold privacy and data protection, maintain sound data governance, and ensure security against vulnerabilities and adversarial misuse.

### 5. Reliability and safety

AI systems should be reliable, accurate, and reproducible as appropriate, and should not pose unreasonable safety risks. Ongoing monitoring and risk management are required.

### 6. Transparency and explainability

Responsible disclosure should explain what systems do and why, for users, creators, operators, investigators, regulators, legal processes, and the public. Disclosures should be timely and provide understandable justification for outcomes.

### 7. Contestability

There should be accessible mechanisms to challenge AI system use or outcomes when impacts are significant. Oversight should enable effective review, especially for decisions affecting rights.

### 8. Accountability

Individuals and organizations responsible for AI lifecycle phases should be accountable for outcomes. Clear responsibility and appropriate levels of human oversight are required, including external review for significant impacts on rights.
